# Cheap_3

Python files for cheap quadrature over spline curvilinear polygons and 3D domains (w.r.t. QMC based measures).
In particular

demo_ADE: quadrature of polynomial integrands (to establish numerically the properties regarding the degree of exactness),

demo_CUB: quadrature of polynomial integrands,

demo_CPU: average cputimes of the rules,

demo_WEIGHTS: distribution of the weights,

demo_SUMWEIGHTS: stability of the rules.

Furthermore, a routine shows the geometry of the domain and the distribution of the nodes in a parallelepiped containing the integration domain.
